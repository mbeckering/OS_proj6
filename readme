***UNFINISHED***

This program us unfinished and not working, so feel free to skip grading for 
now, or score as needed for an incomplete. Tough timing for me on this one 
so I'm going to take advantage of the "project 7" do-over to replace this 
grade.

Implemented: user behavior, interrupt handling, message queue, shared memory 
with sim clock and data structures for virtual memory management, user 
termination procedures for both natural termination and invalid memory
requests, fork/execcing user processes according to sim clock, getopt for 
command line option to specify max # of concurrent user processes.

TODO: OSS request handling (the main goal), logging, statistics output.

Operating System Simulator: Virtual Memory Management
Second-Chance FIFO Page Replacement Algorithm
OSS fork/execs "user" processes at bounded intervals on a simulated sys clock.
Up to 18 concurrent "user" processes continually request memory from OSS.
Usage: ./oss [-p <1-18> ] p: number of concurrent users allowed
