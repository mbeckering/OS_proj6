**4/26/18**UNFINISHED**

This program us unfinished and not working, though most functions and pseudo 
code are in place. I will use this as my do-over "project" 7, so feel free to 
skip grading for now, or score as needed for an incomplete.

Operating System Simulator: Virtual Memory Management
Second-Chance FIFO Page Replacement Algorithm
OSS fork/execs "user" processes at bounded intervals on a simulated sys clock.
Up to 18 concurrent "user" processes continually request memory from OSS.
Usage: ./oss [-p <1-18> ] p: number of concurrent users allowed
